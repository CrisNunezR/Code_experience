Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Changes tend to concentrate in the middle section of the winning teams for a small number of simulations

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After 1000 simulations (for that number, the results tend to present marginal improvements as the number of simulations increase): TODO
