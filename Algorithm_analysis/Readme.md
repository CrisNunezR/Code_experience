This folder contains solutions and personal notes for the classes in the Algorithm Specialization by Stanford University's professor Tim Roughgarden via Coursera.

Specifically, at the moment the files cover the course "Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms".

File "Asymptotic_Analysis_and_Notation" covers Big-Oh, Theta and Omega notations as well as the Master Method, with explanations, code and exercises.

The files named "Week_n_Quiz" cover personal notes and explanations for the math and code I used to solve the Quiz corresponding to week 'n' in the course.

The files named "Week_n_Exercises" include the code and explanations I prepared for the tests required by the course to approve week 'n'. 
    -The exercise in Week 1 exercise requires programming a Karatsuba algorithm to multiply two large integers. 
    -The exercise in Week 2 requires coding a recursive merge-sort algorithm to (efficiently) count the number of inversions in a list of 100,000 elements.
    -Exercise in Week 3 contains the code I prepared to implement a QuickSort algorithm with 3 different methods to define the pivot. The exercise ultimately requires counting the number of comparisons between elements that are needed with different pivot selection methods.
