    "- **Graph**: in Computer Science, a **graph** is a data structure formed by nodes (usually called **vertices** or vertex in its singular form) and a set of connections between these verteces, known normally as **edges**. Graphs are used to model relationships between objects and are widely used in network design, social network analysis, routing algorithms, etc. A graph G is usually written as G = (V, E), where V is the number of vertices and E the number of edges in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Edges**: as described above, the connection between vertices are known as edges, which can be undirected (defining a connection that goes 'both ways' between the vertices it connects) or directed (when the connection goes in only one direction between the nodes or vertices). Graphs with (mostly) undirected edges are commonly called undirected, while those with (mostly) directed edges are called directed. Notice that vertices can be directly connected by more than one edge (even when it might seem redundant).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Image 1** below represents a 10 vertex undirected graph:\n",
    "<img src=\"Week_4_graph_example_iter0.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As indicated in the problem, graphs can be represented as lists of lists (or arrays), where each list represents a vertex and its connections with other vertices via edges. For example, the array representing vertex '1' and its connections the graph of \"Image 1\" can be written as: [1, 2, 4, 7, 8], since vertex 1 is directly connected with nodes/vertices 2, 4, 7, and 8.\n",

    "#### Random Contraction (Karger) algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Random contraction algorithm** (also known as Karger's algorithm) is a randomised algorithm used to fin the minimum cut in a graph. It works by randomly selecting 2 connected vertices and contracting their edges, doing this repeatedly until only 2 'mega-contracted-vertices\" remain, which represent the cut of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it can be shown that this algorithm has a probability of finding the optimal or minimal cut with a probability of $\\frac{2}{n(n-1)}$, or $\\frac{1}{n^2}$ to simplify. Though this probability is not particularly, high we usually perform the algorithm several times, increasing the chance of finding the optimal cut (in general, using $2^n$ independent trials for a n-vertices graph, we can be fairly certain we'll find the optimal cut).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Karger's algorithm example:\n",
    "Let's use the graph in image one to see how the algorithm would work:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **1st contraction**: Let's assume we randomly selected vertex '1' and then vertex '2' between all vertices connected to vertex '1' via one or more edges. This means that vertex 1 and 2 are collapsed into 1, so we:\n",
    "   -  Select one vertex to 'eliminate' or collapse onto the other one (say we chose vertex '2')\n",
    "   -  Eliminate vertex '2' from the list of connected vertices of vertex '1' (the remaining vertex)\n",
    "   -  Add all vertices connected to vertex '2' into the list of connections to vertex '1' if they are not there yet.\n",
    "   - Replace vertex '2' (collapsed) for vertex '1' (remaining) on all other vertices' connections lists/arrays.\n",
