    "To solve this question it's important to first remember that a **_Tree_** with n nodes (or vertices), is an acyclic (has no cycles) and connected (there's a path between every pair of nodes) graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "In detail, the characteristics of tree-graphs are:\n",
    "- Connectivity: Every pair of nodes is connected by **exactly one path**, so there are no isolated nodes nor more than one way to '*travel*' from one node to any another.\n",
    "- Edges: a tree with n nodes has **exactly (n-1) edges**.\n",
    "- Acyclic: the tree contains **no cycles**, that is, there is no way to start from one node and return to the same node following the edges in the tree (for any node).\n",
    "- Undirected: typically, trees are considered to be undirected graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "An intuitive way to solve this problem is to see that we basically have 2 shapes of trees (or 3 if we consider the mix of the two as a third type):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Week_4_tree_1.png\"> <img src=\"Week_4_tree_2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first case, it's easy to see that we can have a cut with 1 node and another with (n-1) nodes, we can repeat the same process with 2 nodes and (n-2) nodes, and so on until we have (n-1) and 1 node, forming \"n-1\" cuts. Given the properties of the trees, all these cuts will have just 1 edge connecting the 2 section of the cut. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for the second case, we can have a cut with node 1 from the vertical section and all the other (n-1) nodes grouped together. We can repeat the process for all the nodes on the vertical section, forming \"n-1\" cuts. Notice that any node not including the vertex/node \"0\" will have more than one edge conneting the two sections of the cut (so it won't be a minimum cut). \n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, the answer to this question is **(n-1)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove this in a more \"*formal way*\" we need to use mathematical induction. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Claim: All trees with n nodes have (n-1) minimum cuts**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Base case (n=1): We assume the claim to be true for n=1. A tree with just one node has no edges, so we have indeed (1-1) = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Case n = k: we assume the claim to be true for n=k, that is, a tree with k nodes has (k-1) minimum cuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Case n = k + 1. We need to prove that a tree with (k+1) nodes has k minimum cuts. We can separate this tree into 2 sections, one with k nodes and another with 1 node. We know from the case n=k and by induction that the first section has (k-1) minimum cuts, and we know that the section with 1 node is connected to the section with k nodes by one edge (since the graph is a tree). This means that the last node represents an additional minimun cut (since removing its edge disconnects the two sections). So, for the whole tree with n=k+1, we have **(k-1)+1=k minimum cuts**, which is the claim we are trying to validate."
