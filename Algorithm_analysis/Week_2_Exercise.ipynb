    "Remember that the 'brute force' approach has a $\\Theta(n^2)$ time-complexity but, we can use a sort-and-count approach to achieve a $\\Theta(nlogn)$ time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm will have the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    " &emsp;1) Divide the complete list into 2 halves: left and right\\\n",
    " &emsp;2) Order the  left half and count every time numbers are re-ordered (as this is an inversion)\\\n",
    " &emsp;3) Order the  right half and count every time numbers are re-ordered (as this is too an inversion)\\\n",
    " &emsp;4) Count the inversions between numbers in the left and right (by now sorted) sections of the list. We do this by creating a final list that takes numbers in order from the left or right section. Every time we take an element from the right section, we know there's an inversion, since the left section was the 1st in the whole list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that ordering a list has a time-complexity $\\Theta(nlogn)$, where 'n' is the length of the list. Taking elements from either of the lists after ordering them, on the other hand, has a time-complexity of $\\Theta(n)$, so the overall complaxity of the algorithm will be $\\Theta(nlogn)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another concept to remember is that an inversion is a pair of indices (i,j) in a list A, where i<j and A[i]>A[j]. So, for example, list A=[1,3,5,2,4,6] has 3 inversions [3,2] (since i=1, j=3, so i<j, but A[1]=3 > A[3]=2), [5,2], and [5,4].\n"
